Description for the interface library that will generate Mandelbrot images

A new header file called "set_determination.h" will contain the interface for determining what values aren't in the Mandelbrot set.
- This new file would be in a new folder called "image_generator".
- complex.h and complex.c should move to a this new folder "image_generator" do to their usage in the final Mandelbrot image generation.
- This is also where the image library tools will eventually be used.
